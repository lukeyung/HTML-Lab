        <h1>Clarified Butter</h1>
        <p>Our decadent English muffins are cooked in butter, a great cooking medium with one major drawback—the milk solids in butter burn easily. Clarifying the butter is an easy process that removes the milk solids. Leftover clarified butter can be used like oil for sautéing food. It keeps for a few weeks in a refrigerated covered container.</p>

        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>1 lb/455 g unsalted butter, cut up</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until completely melted and boiling. Cook until the butter stops sputtering, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the surface of the butter.</li>
            <li>Line a wire sieve with dampened, wrung-out cheesecloth and place it over a medium bowl. Carefully pour the clear, yellow melted butter through the sieve, leaving the milky residue behind in the saucepan. (Discard the residue.) Pour the clarified butter into a small container and cover. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
